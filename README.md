# QuarkOS 
# A fully non-unix family OS bulit from scratch hex and asm

Unlike IOS, Microsoft, Android and other highly user freindly Operating Sys, quarkOS is more of a linux like Operating sys as you 
have the freedom to develop on top of a kernal and is built for specifically for servers and developers . 
However, quarkOS is not fully linux based as it does not come originate from bell labs/unix and is fully independent.

Key Info:

- Built for Developers and Servers                    [ 1 ]
- Built for Kernal Development                        [ 2 ]
- Non-Unix (fully Independent)                        [ 3 ]
- Highly Flexable                                     [ 4 ]
- Built in command-line                               [ 5 ]
- Bulit in IDE                                        [ 6 ]
- Advanced Boot Sys                                   [ 7 ]

5. The command-line is equipped with both compiling and exercuting functions to make life eaiser for software developers 
   or hobbyist developers for personal projects.
   
6. The in-built IDE comes pre-insatlled with around seven differnt programing languages including the main three basic 
   web development languages: HTML, CSS and JS. However, you can install various other languages which you can enable with just
   one click. Also, the IDE is not just a hub to work on practically all the know programing ot there but is a real-time
   collaborative text/code editor so others can join and work on the same project.
   
7. The boot system is much unique to all others as it requires the user ( you ) to insert or swipe a special keycard over a
   an NFC piece of hardware to unlock the computers boot system which then redirects you to the main OS as defalt or a 
   pre-existing kernal in development. With the NFC sys you have the option of swiping then having 15 seconds to type your 
   keycode in or just place on top of the piece of the hardware for unlimited time to enter the keycode. Once you have used
   the key card for access you then have to insert the keycard so that your user is unlocked and you can access your personal
   account. Then, by removing the keycard your account will lock and your data will be secure from others until you retern to
   insert the card and continue with your current task. Reterning to the unlock sys, there is a protocol in place for if you
   are unable to memorise the keycode to enable your card to be understood by the computers emmbeded software and emmbeded 
   hardware; this protocol is booted when you get the keycode incorrect exactly three times. The protocol is just a link 
   which will appear after these three attempts and if clicked will redirect you a screen which will send a message to the 
   quarkOS team and print an A4 page of code out on your printer. This code will be your certificate to verify that you are 
   a legal user to what has been sent to the quarkOS team. THE FOLLOWING TRANSACTION MUST BE DONE WITHIN ONE DAY. 
   You have to bring the certificate to a shop such as currys or pc world where if your papers match with the online 
   deatials in which have been sent from your computer to the quarkOS team then redirected to a shop like currys near you 
   which you will be notified on via your device then the shop will tell quarkOS that the details match and you will be
   given a number to type into your computer to enable the quarkOS team to take remote access to your computer to reset the 
   hardware to match the keycard. This will take around 1hr and 30min to compleate as the security sys has to be secure against
   illigal accessing.
